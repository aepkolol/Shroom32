## The fan shroud 

This is the part that actually blows the humidified air out of the main body. To start, you'll need a 5015 radial fan. Remove the top casing from the fan by breaking off the tabs. You'll also need to remove the "ears". I used wire cutters to snip the casing beside the ears and bent them off. You can be pretty messy with this, it's going inside another enclosure. It just needs to fit, and the fan blades need to spin freely.

Now place this modified fan inside the fanshroud.stl you printed off. Fit the wiring of the fan in the wire path and through the hole at the end of the path.

Now you can screw the "dripcatch.stl" to the fan shroud using 3x countersunk M3 screws.

Drill a hole in the highlighted spots on the fanshroud.stl. This is where the wiring for the BME688 (And possibly the neopixels later) will exit the body. Where the holes are is really up to you and how you want the sensor positioned. 

## The main body

Insert 4x M3 heated inserts into the 4 holes on the back of the main body using a soldering iron. If you haven't done this before, read a guide on 3D printed heating inserts before attempting this.

Solder/attach your V+, GND and SENSE wires to the waterlevel sensor if you're using it. Then use some double sided foam tape, or hot glue to mount it to the mounting point inside the main body.

Add a length of 6.5mm silicone tubing inside the main body in the spots provided. 1 - 1.5ft is probably more than enough.

Feed the wires from the water sensor and fan through the exit hole in the main body. Now use 4x M3 screws to secure it to the "dripcatch.stl"

Add the TPE gaskets to the bottom lid of the main body. Apply a thick coating of silicone grease along the gasket to help seal the main body and keep it water tight. I found it helped thread the screws into the bottom to hold the gasket in place while you install the bottom lid.

Place the ultrasonic mister into the bottom lid, and run the wires through the main body past the water sensor and out the same hole as the rest of the wiring.

Now screw the bottom to the main body.

## Outside the tub

Place the "outsidebox.stl" in the position you want it to be installed on the fruiting tub. Use a 3mm drill bit to drill 4 holes through the tub where the mounting screws will pass through. Use a bigger bit, series of small holes, a dremel, etc to cut the square hole where the wires and water tube will pass through the box.

Use 4x M3 countersunk screws to mount the shroom32 to the fruiting tub

Use M2.5 screws to secure the relay and DC buck to the body.

Attach the potentiometer to the outside box cover. Now is a good time to also solder the 3 wires to the legs.

Start wiring!

Close everything up with the box cover. You can pass the water tube though the hole in the top and the DC input wires through the hole in the side.
